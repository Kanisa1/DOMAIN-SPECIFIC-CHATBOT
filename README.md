# 🧠 Domain-Specific Chatbot: Healthcare Question-Answering using FLAN‑T5

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a **Healthcare Question-Answering Chatbot** designed to provide accurate, domain-specific medical information. The chatbot leverages **Google’s Flan‑T5 (Base)** Transformer model fine-tuned on a curated medical Q&A dataset. The goal is to assist users in understanding health-related topics such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, by delivering concise and reliable responses.

### 🎯 Domain Alignment

The chatbot aligns with the **Healthcare** domain, focusing on improving public access to medically relevant knowledge. Its purpose is to simulate domain-aware conversation and provide accurate educational insights — **not** medical advice — helping users explore conditions, symptoms, and preventive care topics.

## 🗂️ Dataset Collection & Preprocessing

**Dataset Size:** 16,407 question–answer pairs
**Sources:** NIH, CDC, Cancer.gov (public domain health repositories)

### Data Preparation

* **Formatting:** Converted to T5-compatible format → `"question: [question] context: [context]"`
* **Splits:**

  * Train: 13,000 samples
  * Validation: 1,600 samples
  * Test: 1,600 samples
* **Tokenization:** T5Tokenizer (word-piece tokenization)
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Normalized text (lowercasing, punctuation cleanup)
  * Removed duplicates and empty samples
  * Padded sequences dynamically

This ensures clean, structured data optimized for generative question-answering.

## ⚙️ Model Fine‑Tuning

**Model Used:** Google Flan‑T5 Base (250M parameters)

### Training Configuration

| Parameter     | Value                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Learning Rate | 3e‑4                                    |
| Batch Size    | 8                                       |
| Epochs        | 3                                       |
| Warmup Steps  | 500                                     |
| Optimizer     | AdamW                                   |
| Framework     | PyTorch (via Hugging Face Transformers) |

### Experiments

Several hyperparameter trials were conducted, adjusting learning rate and epochs. The final configuration improved validation performance by **~12%** over the baseline. Models were saved as:

* `best_healthcare_t5/` → Best-performing checkpoint
* `final_healthcare_t5/` → Final trained model

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics & Results

Evaluation combined **quantitative** and **qualitative** analysis.

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric      | Description                | Result                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **BLEU**    | Translation quality metric | ✓ Moderate fluency improvement |
| **ROUGE‑1** | Unigram overlap            | ✓ Strong recall                |
| **ROUGE‑2** | Bigram overlap             | ✓ Moderate coherence           |
| **ROUGE‑L** | Longest common subsequence | ✓ Consistent structure         |

### Qualitative Testing

* Compared model predictions with gold-standard answers.
* Observed strong generalization within healthcare queries.
* Out-of-domain prompts are rejected gracefully.
